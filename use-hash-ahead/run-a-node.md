# Run a node

## What it means to Run a node

In a blockchain network, a node is a computer or server running blockchain protocol software. The nodes are connected together through the Internet to jointly maintain and manage the blockchain network, and complete core functions such as block packaging, transaction verification, and consensus algorithms.

Running a node means that users can join the blockchain network through their own computers or servers, become part of the network, and participate in the management and maintenance of the network. Specifically, running nodes can help speed up transaction confirmation, ensure transaction security and reliability, support new blockchain applications and functions, etc.

At the same time, running nodes also requires certain technical and hardware support, such as the need to install and configure blockchain protocol software, maintain the stability and security of nodes, and handle large amounts of data traffic. Therefore, users need to have certain technical and hardware capabilities, and understand the relevant rules and requirements for running nodes.

In short, running a node is a way to participate in the blockchain network, which can help users understand and participate in the blockchain technology and ecology more deeply.

## Why run node

Running a node allows you to use the HSAH AHEAD network in a truly private and self-sufficient manner while supporting the ecosystem, and the node will verify all transactions and blocks by itself according to the consensus rules. This means you don't have to depend on any other nodes in the network, and you can customize RPC endpoints, ports, etc.

## Node type in Hash Ahead

### Full Node

A full node is a special node in the blockchain network, which completely replicates the transaction records and block data of the entire blockchain, instead of only saving part of the data or only participating in the verification and confirmation of transactions. Specifically, full nodes save all transactions and blocks on the blockchain, can verify the legitimacy of any transaction, and participate in the generation and verification of blocks.

### Light Node

Light Node refers to a node that does not need to fully replicate the entire blockchain data. Compared with full nodes, light nodes only need to maintain the block header (Block Header) and related Merkle tree data structures, instead of downloading and storing all transaction records and block data. Light nodes can obtain corresponding data and information by querying full nodes or using special protocols to verify transactions.

### Validator

In blockchain, validators are nodes responsible for validating transactions and generating new blocks. Verification nodes are composed of miners or users who hold certain tokens in the network. By running nodes, they participate in consensus algorithms and node elections, and verify whether transactions and blocks on the network are legal and valid. Validation nodes play a vital role in the blockchain, they are an important part of ensuring the security and decentralization of the blockchain network.

### Atomic Node

Atomic Node is a special node that can maintain multiple different blockchain networks at the same time and support cross-chain transactions. Atomic nodes can intercommunicate transactions of different blockchains, thereby realizing the transfer and transaction of cross-chain assets. Atomic nodes usually need to have the support of multi-chain protocols, such as Cross-Chain Protocol or Side-Chain Protocol, as well as the support of a variety of different digital assets.

## Steps to run a node

The steps to create and run a node in hash ahead are as follows:

### Prepare the hardware environment

The minimum hardware requirements are: CPU: 16 cores, Memory: 32G Bandwidth: 100M, SSD: 2.5T or more

### Install software

Method 1: Once the hardware is ready, you can download the DAppNode operating system to any computer and install it on a brand new SSD via a USB flash drive.&#x20;

Method 2: Experienced users may prefer to use the command line for maximum control. Check out our developer documentation to learn more about getting started with client selection.

### Run node

Run the hash ahead node through the command line.
