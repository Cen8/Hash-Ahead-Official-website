# NFT

With Hash Ahead high speed and low fees make it a perfect fit for NFTs of all shapes and sizes.

## What is NFT

NFT is the abbreviation of Non-Fungible Token (non-homogeneous token), which is a digital asset based on blockchain technology, which is irreplaceable, unique and verifiable. It has a wide range of application values in digital artworks, game props, virtual real estate and other fields.

### Irreplaceable

NFT is a non-homogeneous token. Unlike ordinary cryptocurrencies, each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced or interchanged

### Unique

NFT can represent various digital assets such as digital artwork, music, game props, etc. Each NFT has its unique attributes and values

### Verifiability

Since NFT is based on blockchain technology, its ownership and transaction history can be recorded and verified, ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital assets.

## Homogeneous Tokens VS Non-Fungible Tokens

Simply put, an NFT is a token with a unique identifier and additional parameters that allow you to store certain information about it. This unique identifier makes the token non-fungible. Additional information can be any information such as text, images, audio and video files. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies, NFTs are unique and not fungible. Since each bitcoin or ether is unified and practically indistinguishable from other coins, you can freely trade them on cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Homogeneous currency (Ethereum/Bitcoin)

* Interchangeable
* Consistent
* Can be traded on exchanges&#x20;
* Similar to currency or stock&#x20;
* Divisible
* Divisible into decimals

For example, 1 bitcoin can be divisible by at most 0.0000001 bitcoin, thus providing better liquidity for exchanging tokens.

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

* Non-exchangeable&#x20;
* Unique
* Can be traded on the market
* Used in the field of games, collectibles, artworks, intellectual property&#x20;
* Indivisible
* Cannot be divided into parts
* Usually illiquid and difficult to sell immediately

## NFT Application

NFT has a wide range of applications and plays its unique role in many fields.

### Art and Collectibles Field

NFTs can be used to ensure the uniqueness and authenticity of digital artwork and collectibles, preventing counterfeiting and piracy, while providing creators with a fair means of revenue distribution.

### Game Field

NFT can be used for the ownership and transaction of game props and virtual items, providing players with a real sense of ownership and freedom of transaction.

### Real Estate Field

NFT can be used to represent the ownership of real estate, making real estate transactions more transparent and efficient.

### Copyright field

NFT can be used to ensure the copyright and usage rights of digital content, allowing copyright owners and users to better negotiate and reach agreement.

### Sports Field

NFT is also widely used in the field of sports. Some sports brands, clubs and athletes have already started using NFTs to promote their brands, host competitions or provide digital experiences.

## Advantages of NFTs

### Authenticity And Efficiency

Verification of authenticity and transaction efficiency are often pain points for irreplaceable commodities. For example, if someone bought the Mona Lisa and then tried to sell it, it would be difficult to verify its authenticity without an art expert. A plagiarist may make multiple copies and sell them to different buyers.

With digital art, it's easier to create copies and claim the work as their own; and unlike the real world, there's no way to verify which digital image is the original. This is where NFTs come in. NFTs use smart contract technology to store and record unique information on the blockchain, which means that no matter when an NFT is created, only one NFT is verifiably present. NFT creators can also encrypt details such as rich metadata or secure file links, allowing people to create a variety of verifiable digital assets based on image, audio and video files. These technologies allow everyone to verify the authenticity of digital assets and simplify the process of determining ownership. It also allows for the safe, efficient and verifiable transfer of assets.

NFTs Remove Middlemen

Art is just one example of how NFTs disrupt intermediaries, and the key lesson is that NFTs can tokenize anything and remove inefficiencies beyond authenticity.

Have you ever wondered why some key documents are still recorded on paper? This is because there is no way to verify that a certain digital copy is unique and trustworthy. NFTs will change that, pioneering the creation of outstanding digital art, collectibles, in-game items, and even important documents like wills, passports, and land titles.

## The Future Of NFTs

In the future, NFT will play a huge role in all walks of life, combining the value of the real world with the digital world. NFT will enable individuals and businesses to better manage and trade their assets, and will create entirely new revenue streams and business models. At the same time, it will also provide more opportunities for artists, musicians, game developers and creative talents to gain more control over the copyright and income of their works. The future of NFT is full of infinite possibilities, and we look forward to seeing it realize its huge potential on a global scale.
