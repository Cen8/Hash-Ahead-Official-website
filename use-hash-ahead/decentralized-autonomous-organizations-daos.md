# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOS)

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

### What is DAOS

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are a form of organization based on blockchain technology that aims to achieve decentralized decision-making and autonomy. DAOs operate based on smart contracts, and they allow users to organize and manage funds, resources, and projects in a decentralized manner without the central control and intervention of intermediaries in traditional organizational forms. DAOs typically consist of a group of people who hold tokens that represent ownership and control over the organization, who can vote in an equal fashion and determine the direction of the organization and the allocation of funds. DAOs are gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community as an innovative and transparent form of organization.

### The importance of DAOS in the blockchain ecology

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have an important necessity in the blockchain ecology. The essence of blockchain technology is decentralization and trustlessness, and DAOs are the best embodiment of this concept. They provide a new form of organization that enables individuals and organizations to cooperate and collaborate in a decentralized, transparent and fair manner. By using smart contracts and token incentives, DAOs can enable trustless cooperation and decision-making, thereby promoting more democratic and inclusive community governance. In decentralized finance and other decentralized applications, DAOs have become an important form of organization, enabling participants to jointly manage and operate these systems, thereby achieving a more fair, transparent and open financial system.

### How DAOS works

Rules are voted by the community and written into the DAO's smart contract. A DAO is a digital organization run by a pre-determined set of rules and/or code on the blockchain, meaning no one person or entity has control over it. It operates through decentralized consensus-based decision-making, meaning that decisions are made through community votes.

How do DAOs work in practice? First, anyone can join the DAO by purchasing tokens, which represent a stake in the organization and give users voting rights. The DAO's rules are written into its code and stored on the blockchain, meaning they cannot be changed without everyone's consent.

Decisions are then made through a democratic process based on the votes of token holders. Token holders have the power to vote on changes and decisions, including who gets funded, which projects go forward, and more. This allows for a transparent and democratic decision-making process.

## DAOS IN Hash Ahead

### Governance Mechanism

In order to make Hash Ahead more healthy and long-term development, we have formulated a series of community governance rules. Every token holder can participate in community governance. Hash Ahead's governance model is online governance, which ensures that the proposal process is open and transparent, and accepts everyone's supervision. Both token holders and the council can initiate proposals, and the proposals will eventually need to go through a referendum for token holders to make a decision.

### Involved Role

The roles involved in the community governance model include ordinary HAH holders, councils, and technical committees. The council is an on-chain entity consisting of multiple participants, each represented as an on-chain account. The main responsibilities of the council include: proposing proposals beneficial to community development, preventing malicious proposals from passing resolutions, and electing technical committees. Members of the Technical Committee are appointed by the Council. Appointed members should have professional knowledge of the Hash Ahead protocol.

### Referendum

All governance decisions start with a proposal and are established through a popular referendum. Proposals in Hash Ahead can start in three forms: - from the public, any HAH token holder - from the council, which is composed of publicly elected HAH holders - the technical committee can also be used in special cases Submit urgent proposals (such as fixing on-chain code bugs).
