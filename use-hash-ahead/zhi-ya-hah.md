The way to pledge HAH is usually to send HAH digital assets to the designated smart contract address and lock them for a certain period of time according to the stipulated pledge requirements.

The main purpose of staking HAH is to support the stable operation and development of the Hash Ahead public chain ecology, and at the same time obtain corresponding benefits or rights.
