# Hash Ahead Development Roadmap

## The first stage

Realize the function:

* Realize an infinitely scalable multi-chain structure, provide a consensus base chain + functional ship chain to form a multi-chain structure, and infinitely expand the functional ship chain;
* Realize decentralized smart contract library, high-performance WASM virtual machine, and incentives for smart contract code authors;
* Provide block browser and wallet APP functions.

## The second stage

Realize the function:

* Implement a new consensus mechanism;
* Realize fast full-chain verification structure, real-time block production, and remove empty blocks;
* Realize multi-layer P2P network structure, block fragmentation transmission, and efficient transmission path;
* Realize dynamic candidate node election, lightweight verification nodes, node selective verification, dynamic block rewards, overlapping block production verification, dynamic minimum "force" price adjustment;
* Realize the decentralized exchange of the order book model and realize the decentralized shuttle bridge function.

## The third phase

Realize the function:

* Realize the function of no fork upgrade and community governance function;
* Realize light node function, provide application development SDK and documentation;
* Implement an application development toolset;
* Realize distributed data storage and query and reward mechanism;
* Realize the node data compression function.
