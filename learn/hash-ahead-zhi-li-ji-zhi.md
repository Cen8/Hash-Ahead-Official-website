# Hash Ahead governance mechanism

## Community Governance

In order to make Hash Ahead more healthy and long-term development, we have formulated a series of community governance rules. Every token holder can participate in community governance. Hash Ahead's governance model is online governance, which ensures that the proposal process is open and transparent, and accepts everyone's supervision. Both token holders and the council can initiate proposals, and the proposals will eventually need to go through a referendum for token holders to make a decision.

## Community Governance Participation Role

### Council

The council is an on-chain entity consisting of multiple participants, each represented as an on-chain account. In Hash Ahead, the Council currently consists of 13 members. The main responsibilities of the council include: proposing proposals beneficial to community development, preventing malicious proposals from passing resolutions, and electing technical committees. The election algorithm for council members is the "Phragm√©n Election Algorithm". HAH holders can become candidates for council members by staking their tokens. The public can elect candidates, and finally sort according to the number of votes and determine the final council members.

### Technical committee

Members of the Technical Committee are appointed by the Council, not by public vote. Appointed members should have a professional understanding of the Hash Ahead protocol, and development teams that have established their own more complete projects on the Hash Ahead chain are more likely to be appointed as members of the technical committee. Hash Ahead's development team will also be a member of the technical committee. The technical committee can launch an emergency referendum to fix code errors in real time or add new features that have been proven to be beneficial to community development.

## Hash Ahead Governance Process

All governance decisions start with a proposal and are established through a popular referendum. Proposals in Hash Ahead can start in three forms: - from the public, any HAH token holder - from the council, which is composed of publicly elected HAH holders - the technical committee can also be used in special cases Submit urgent proposals (such as fixing on-chain code bugs).

Anyone can initiate a proposal by staking the minimum amount of HAH within a certain period of time. The process of initiating a proposal is as follows:

### Off-chain proposal

Publish the proposal on the Hash Ahead official website or github for discussion and feedback to improve the proposal. This step is not necessary, but it is conducive to collecting more opinions and improving the proposal, avoiding repeated revisions of the proposal on the chain;

### On-Chain Proposal

The publisher determines the final proposal, submits the proposal on the chain, and waits for the council to review;

### Council hearing

The council votes on the proposal. If more than 50% of the members vote in favor, the proposal passes the resolution of the council and can enter the next stage. If the proposal fails to pass the vote of the council, the proposal will be rejected and no follow-up process can be carried out.

### Proposal referendum

Proposals voted by the council enter the referendum stage, where the public votes on the proposals.

### Proposal implementation

After the referendum, successful proposals will enter a lock-up period before enactment; rejected proposals will be discarded directly. The winning party's tokens will be locked and cannot be transferred until the end of the lockup period. After the successful referendum on the proposal, it will be handed over to the technical committee for implementation, code development and testing will be completed, and then the system will automatically complete the upgrade.

Every 28 days, the public will vote on a new referendum. Multiple referendums cannot be held within the same time period, except for emergency referendums initiated by technical committees.
