## How to keep your wallet safe

### Use Trusted Wallet Software

Using verified official or reputable third-party wallet software reduces the risk of your wallet being hacked or defrauded.

### Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication

Creating a strong password and enabling two-factor authentication can improve the security of your wallet. A strong password should be complex enough to include numbers, letters, and special characters. Two-factor authentication can add an extra layer of protection to your account and usually involves entering a verification code or using a security token.

### Backup and encrypt private keys

Backing up your private keys and storing them in a safe place, such as an offline storage device, can restore access if your wallet is damaged or lost. At the same time, encrypting the private key can also increase security and prevent unauthorized access.

### Handle transactions and transfers with care

Confirm details of transactions and transfers, such as recipient address and amount, to avoid accidental transfers or fraud.

### Avoid using public networks

When using a wallet, you should avoid using public networks, such as public WiFi, to prevent network monitoring and attacks.
