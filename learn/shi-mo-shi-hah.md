# What is HAH

HAH is digital global money. This is the currency in the hash ahead app.

## What are encrypted assets

Encrypted assets are blockchain-based assets. Due to the characteristics of blockchain ledgers (data storage systems that record transaction data), these assets do not have to rely on trusted third-party financial institutions for maintenance. At the same time, these encrypted assets can also be widely used for payment and purchase of goods.

## What is HAH

HAH is the native token of the Hash Ahead network, which has the functions of governing the network and operating the network. Good participants will be rewarded with tokens through the smart contract mechanism, while saboteurs will be fined and confiscated tokens. Hash Ahead ensures the safe and stable operation and development of the network through such a reward and punishment mechanism. The second function of HAH is to promote the consensus mechanism supporting Hash Ahead. In order for the platform to function properly, Hash Ahead will rely on HAH holders to play an active role. Participants will perform these functions by staking HAH, which will inhibit malicious network transactions. HAH is the on-chain asset of Hash Ahead, and it is also an acceptable payment method on Hash Ahead. When anyone wants to complete a transaction, they must pay a certain amount of HAH to make the transaction recognized by the blockchain. At the same time, the more HAH you pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

### Where does HAH come from?

HAH is symbiotic with the block. When the owner of the atomic node creates a block on the base chain, a new HAH is created.

### Transmission of HAH

For each transaction on Hash Ahead, the initiator's address transfers HAH to the recipient's address, and when the user calls the smart contract, the addresses of these recipients will become a smart contract, and part of the HAH will be given to the smart contract author as a reward. The other part is consumed as transaction fees.

### HAH Query

Users can query through the  Block Saver wallet APP, or through the Hash Ahead browser.

## HAH makes hash ahead run and keeps hash ahead safe

HAH (Hash Ahead), as the native token of the Hash Ahead public chain, is the core asset in the Hash Ahead ecosystem. The pledge and voting mechanism of HAH tokens enable holders to participate in the election and voting of nodes, and obtain certain rewards from them, and also contribute to the development of the entire Hash Ahead ecology. Pledging HAH can help maintain the security and stability of the Hash Ahead public chain, and at the same time, you can get token rewards to motivate node operators to provide better services and promote ecological development.

In the Hash Ahead public chain, the HAH token is one of the keys to network operation. It is not only used for transaction payment and handling fees, but also for ecological construction such as node election and voting. The value and liquidity of HAH tokens are directly related to the ecological development and user experience of the Hash Ahead public chain. Therefore, holding and pledging HAH tokens is crucial to the stable operation and development of the Hash Ahead ecosystem.
