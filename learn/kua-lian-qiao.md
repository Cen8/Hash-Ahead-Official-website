# Cross-chain bridge

## What is a cross-chain bridge

A cross-chain bridge is a technical solution that allows digital assets or data between different blockchains to be transferred and exchanged between them. It is a connection that spans between different blockchains, enabling them to communicate and interoperate with each other. The purpose of the cross-chain bridge is to break down the barriers between various blockchains, enabling them to realize interconnection and transfer and exchange value between different blockchains.

HAH itself supports cross-chain transactions and data transmission, and can interoperate with other public chain projects. At the same time, HAH also supports developers to build cross-chain bridges to connect different blockchain networks to realize functions such as cross-chain transactions and asset transfers. Developers can use the cross-chain bridge development tools and documents provided by HAH to build cross-chain bridges that meet their needs according to their own needs and scenarios.

### Why do we need cross-chain bridges

We need cross-chain bridges because there are currently many different blockchain networks that cannot directly interact and communicate with each other. Cross-chain bridges allow different blockchain networks to be connected, enabling them to achieve cross-chain transactions and asset transfers. In this way, users can freely transfer and exchange assets between different blockchain networks, realizing wider application scenarios and more efficient value transmission. At the same time, the cross-chain bridge also helps to promote collaboration and interoperability between blockchain networks, further promoting the development of the entire blockchain industry.

Using the cross-chain bridge, you can achieve:

* [x] Cross-chain transfer of assets and information
* [x] Dapps to reap the benefits of various blockchains - thereby enhancing their capabilities (as protocols now have more room for innovative design).
* [x] Users access the new platform and take advantage of different chains.
* [x] Developers from different blockchain ecosystems collaborate and build new platforms for users.

## Classification of cross-chain bridges

(1) Off-chain cross-chain bridge: This cross-chain bridge does not run directly on the blockchain, but is performed outside the chain, for example, through a centralized trust agency or a multi-party signature mechanism for cross-chain operations.

(2) On-chain cross-chain bridge: This cross-chain bridge runs directly on the blockchain, and it can achieve interoperability between multiple chains through smart contracts, usually using tokens to lock and unlock to achieve cross-chain transfers .

(3) Atomic swap cross-chain bridge: This cross-chain bridge uses atomic swap technology to conduct point-to-point transactions directly between the two chains, so that transactions between the two chains can be carried out simultaneously, thereby realizing the cross-chain transfer of assets .

(4) Threshold signature cross-chain bridge: This cross-chain bridge uses threshold signature technology to split multiple private keys into multiple parts, and realize cross-chain transfer through multiple nodes co-signing. This cross-chain bridge usually has a higher degree of security and decentralization.

(5) Smart bridge cross-chain bridge: This cross-chain bridge is a relatively new technology that can connect different blockchains into a smart bridge network and interact through smart contracts to achieve cross-chain Chain transfers and interoperability.
